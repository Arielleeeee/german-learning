# 🇩🇪 german-learning

This repository documents my deep commitment to learning German from scratch—an experience that challenged me both mentally and emotionally, and taught me what it means to stay persistent over time.

Learning German was one of the most intense and personal journeys I’ve ever taken. What started as a spark of curiosity became a long-term commitment. I studied every day, often for more than 12 hours, with almost no formal instruction. Instead, I relied on handwritten notes, repetition, self-discipline, and creativity.

My A1–B1 notes are in Taiwan, so I’m not able to include them here.

## 📝 What You’ll Find Here

This repo is a collection of scanned pages from my notebooks. Each page shows how I tried to internalize the language—through:
- Structured notes on grammar, vocabulary, and themes like Klimawandel and Umweltprobleme
- Reading exercises with highlighted text and handwritten annotations
- Word-by-word translations and analysis
- Logic course notes
