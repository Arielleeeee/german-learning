# 🇩🇪 german-learning

This repository documents my journey of learning German from scratch. It reflects how I approached the language with focus, curiosity, and persistence—through both structured study and self-driven exploration.

> 📌 My A1–B1 notes are currently in Taiwan, so they’re not included here.

## 📝 What You’ll Find Here

This is a collection of scanned pages from my handwritten notebooks. Each page shows a part of how I tried to understand and internalize the language, including:

- Grammar and vocabulary notes on themes like Klimawandel and Umweltprobleme
- Reading exercises with annotations and highlights
- Word-by-word breakdowns and translations
- Notes from a logic-focused course written in German
